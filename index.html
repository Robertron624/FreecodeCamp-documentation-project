        <p>
          Python is a highly popular interpreted, high level and general-purpose programming language. It was designed
          with an emphasis on code readability(code that is easy to understand for humans) and help programmers to write
          clear, easy to write and logical code for small and large scale projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is a dynamically-typed language wich means that unlike other languages like C or Java it doesn't
          require the explicit declaration of the type of a variable before using it, because it's type is checked
          during run-time.
          One of Python biggest feature is that there is a large number of libraries ready to install that extend it's
          functions, because of that Python as a ton of applications, here is a list of his most common uses:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Web development: </b>Python offers multiple tools for back-end web development such as the frameworks:
            Django, Flask and Pyramid, this tools simplify tasks like content management and database interactions.</li>
          <li><b>Game development: </b>Python is loaded with many useful libraries that are useful for game development
            like Pygame, Pyglet and PyOpengl.</li>
          <li><b>Scientific investigation: </b>Thanks to his huge number of libraries Python is one of the must used
            programming language to analyse and process scientific data with libraries such as: Pandas, NumPy and SciPy.
          </li>
          <li><b>AI and machine learning:</b>Python is the de facto programming language to create and train machine
            learning and AI models with libraries like: Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch and Pandas.
          </li>

          <li><b>Web-scrapping: </b>Python is a wonderful tool for extracting large amounts of data from web pages like
            product prices and job listings wich can be used for market analysis and Search Engine Optimization.</li>

      <article>
        <p>Before you can start coding in Python you need some things: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dowmload the latest version of Python from it's official web page. <a
              href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Click here </a>to go there</li>
          <li>An IDLE(Integrated DeveLopment Environment) to make it easier for you to write and test your code. My
            favorites are <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS code</a>, <a
              href="https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/pycharm/">Pycharm</a> and <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>.</li>
          <li>You need to have some experience in basic programming concepts and theory. Try to find some introductory
            information about programming languages.</li>

      <article>
        <p><b>Java: </b>ython programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs, but they also take much
          less time to develop. Python programs are typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs. This
          difference can be attributed to Python's built-in high-level data types and its dynamic typing. or example, a
          Python programmer wastes no time declaring the types of arguments or variables, and Python's powerful
          polymorphic list and dictionary types, for which rich syntactic support is built straight into the language,
          find a use in almost every Python program.</p>
        <p><b>Javascript: </b>Python's "object-based" subset is roughly equivalent to JavaScript. Like JavaScript (and
          unlike Java), Python supports a programming style that uses simple functions and variables without engaging in
          class definitions. However, for JavaScript, that's all there is. Python, on the other hand, supports writing
          much larger programs and better code reuse through a true object-oriented programming style, where classes and
          inheritance play an important role.
        </p>

        <p><b>C++: </b> Almost everything said for Java also applies for C++, just more so: where Python code is
          typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent C++
          code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers
          can't complete in a year. Python shines as a glue language, used to combine components written in C++.

        <p>To write your first Python code first open your IDLE of choice and write this popular "Hello world" code in
          python: </p>

        <code>
      print("Hello world!")
    </code>
        <p>Then click run and see the result, it's just that easy and straightforward.</p>

      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Variables are containers for storing data values.
          You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an
          object. To declare a variable in Python you need to follow this syntax: variable-name + the symbol "=" +
          variable value. Here is an example:
        </p>

        <code>
      > name = "John" <br>
      > age = 19
    </code>
        <p>If you then print the variable you will see its value.</p>

        <code>
      > print(name)<br>
      > John<br>
      > print(age)<br>
      > 19
    </code>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scopes">
      <header>Variable scopes</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The part of a program where a variable is accessible is called its scope. There are four major types of
          variable scope and is the basis for the LEGB rule, meaning: Local, Enclosing, Global and Built-in.
        </p>
        <p><b>Local scope: </b>Whenever you define a variable within a function, its scope lies ONLY within the
          function. It is accessible from the point at which it is defined until the end of the function and exists for
          as long as the function is executing. Which means its value cannot be changed or even accessed from outside
          the function. Here's a simple example: </p>

        <code>
        > def print_number():<br>
              <div class="indented-text">local_number = 5 <br>
                print(local_number)<br></div>
        
        > print_number()<br>
        > 5
      </code>

        <p>The variable "local_number" only exists inside the variable so if we try to print it without invoking the
          function it will give us an error.</p>

        <p><b>Enclosing Scope: </b>is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an
          inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope
          contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible
          from the code of the inner and enclosing functions. Take this as example:
        </p>

        <code>
        > def outer(): <br>
              first_num = 1 <br>
              def inner(): <br>
                  second_num = 2<br>
                  print(second_num)<br>
        > outer()<br>
        > 2<br>
      </code>

        <P>The variable "second_num" cannot be accesed from the "outher()" function because the variable doesn't exist
          there. However you can acces the variable "first_num" from "inner()" because that variable as already been
          declared in the upper function. This is an enclosing scope. Outer's variables have a larger scope and can be
          accessed from the enclosed function inner(). </p>


        <p><b>Global scope: </b>This is the easiest scope to understand. Whenever a variable is defined outside any
          function, it becomes a global variable, and its scope is anywhere within the program. Which means it can be
          used by any function. For example: </p>
        <code>
       > greeting = "Hello" <br>
       > def say_hi():
        <div class="indented-text">print(greeting)</div> 
        > say_hi() <br>
        > Hello
      </code>

        <p><b>Built-in scope: </b>This is the widest scope that exists.
          This scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into
          Python. Names in this Python scope are also available from everywhere in your code. It’s automatically loaded
          by Python when you run a program or script.
          These are some of the keywords in Python: </p>
        <code>
        False<br>
        None<br>
        True<br>
        and<br>
        break<br>
        for<br>
        while<br>
        with

      <article>
        <p>Python has the following data types built-in by default: </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Text:</b> string. Example: <code> name = "Robert"</code> </li>
          <li><b>Numeric: </b>integer, float, complex</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declaration">
      <header>Function declaration</header>
      <article>
        <p>A function is a block of code wich only runs when it's called, you can pass data, which we call "parameters"
          into a function. A function can return data as result.</p>
        <p>
          In python a function must be defined with the keyword "def", followed by the name of the function, then two
          parenthesis and finally a colon. Finally indentation is IMPORTANT in Python if we want a block of code to be
          part of a function we must indent it to the function declaration. Here's an example:
        </p>

        <code>
        > def my_function():
        <div class="indented-text">print("Hello world")</div>
      </code>

        <p>To call a function and execute it we use the function's name followed by parenthesis:</p>
        <code>
            > my_function()<br>
            > Hello world
          </code>
      </article>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="If...elif...else_statements">
      <header>If...elif...else statements</header>
      <article>
        <p>The if control structure "If..." allows a program to execute instructions when a condition is fulfilled. It
          follows this syntax: if... condtion...execute or not exceute. For example:</p>

        <code>
      > a = 5<br>
      > b = 10<br>
      > if b > a:
      <div class="indented-text">print("b is greater than a")</div>
      > b is greater than a 
      
    </code>

        <p>
          The "elif" keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this
          condition". Following the example above lets take a look at this one:
        </p>
        <code>
      > a = 20<br>
      > b = 10<br>
      > if b > a:
      <div class="indented-text">print("b is greater than a")</div>
      > elif a > b:
      <div class="indented-text">print("a is greater than b")</div>
      > a is greater than b
      </code>

        <p>Note that the first condition is not true so it doesn't get excuted, then it continues with the second
          condition which is true and it executes it.</p>

        <p>
          The "else" keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions. Let's take a look:

        </p>

        <code>
      > a = 50<br>
      > b = 700<br>
      > if a > b:
      <div class="indented-text">print("a is greater than b")</div>
      > elif a == b:
      <div class="indented-text">print("a is equal to b")</div>
      
      > else:
      <div class="indented-text">print("a is less than b")</div>
      > a is less than b
      
    </code>
        <p>In this case neither the first nor the second condition are true, then if both aren't true then the code
          inside the else statement is excuted.</p>
      </article>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="For_loops">
      <header>For loops</header>

      <article>
        <p>
          A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a
          string).</p>

        <p>This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as
          found in other object-orientated programming languages.</p>

        <p>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. Here's an
          example:

        </p>

        <code>
      > colors = ["blue", "green", "yellow"]<br>
      > for x in fruits:
      <div class="indented-text">print(x)</div>
      > blue<br>
      > green<br>
      > yellow
         
    </code>

      </article>

    </section>


    <section class="main-section" id="While_loops">
      <header>While loops</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. For example:
        </p>

        <code>
      > x = 0<br>
      > while x &lt 6 :
      <div class="indented-text">print(i)</div>
      <div class="indented-text">x = x + 1</div>
      
      > 0<br>
      > 1<br>
      > 2<br>
      > 3<br>

        <p>In the code above we declare a variable with value 0, then we declare a condition, if x is less than 6 we
          print x and we add 1 so it change its value, then the code starts again and again untill x is equal to 6 then
          it stops.</p>
